# Assignment 1

"Musical Play & Experimentation" 

![](images/cybertrad.png.jpg)

For this individual assignment, you will create an interactive musical experience using Godot. You can choose to make:

1. A Musical Instrument/Toy
   - A virtual instrument that makes sounds when you interact with it
   - A musical toy that creates fun sounds and visuals
   - An interactive soundboard with visual feedback

2. A Music Game
   - A simple rhythm game where you match beats
   - A musical memory game
   - You can start by [forking this example](https://github.com/skooter500/duckies2.0)
   - Watch [this video from GodotCon for inspiration](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEZvcG_TIHo)

3. A Music Visualizer
   - Create visual effects that react to music
   - Make patterns and shapes move to sound
   - Create an interactive light show

## Technical Requirements
Your project must include:
- At least one scene with a clear user interface
- Multiple interactive elements (sprites, animations, buttons, sliders, or clickable areas)
- Sound playback or generation
- Visual feedback when sounds play
- At least one loop (for example creating elements in a loop)
- At least one if statement (for example, checking if elements overlap)
- Regular commits to git showing your progress

## Learning Outcomes
- Understanding basic Godot concepts (nodes, scenes, signals)
- Writing simple GDScript code
- Creating user interfaces
- Working with audio in Godot
- Using version control (git)

## Project Ideas
Simple examples you could build on:
- A piano with colorful keys
- Animal sounds toybox for kids
- Simple beat maker with loops
- Shape-based music maker
- Musical memory game
- Audio-reactive particle system
- Drum kit with visual effects
- Sound effects board

## Rubric

| Category | Weighting | 1 | 2.1 | 2.2 | Pass | Fail |
|----------|-----------|--------|----|----|----|----|
| Complexity | 33% | For loops and arrays. Use of different systems in Godot. A lot of new nodes created. Complex UI interaction such as drag and drop, timers, UI controls. UI created procedurally. Lots of variety in the sounds created. Use of controllers or external input. The instrument is "programmable". Sound is generated procedurally. Excellent visual feedback | Simple UI based on clicking buttons to make sounds. Use of loops and at least one array. Use of timers. UI is generated in editor.  No external input. Good variety of sounds. Based on a real instrument | A basic soundboard with buttons to make sounds | Forked the repo, made some commits, not much working, but it makes a sound | Failed to fork the repo, no commits made |
| Aesthetic | 33% | Novel user interface for creating live sound. Complex button and knob arrangement. High quality of visual design. Original, high quality assets produced. Original  recorded audio. Visually coherent and easy to use. Great variety of musical expressiveness. Sounds are interesting and coherent. Crazy and beautiful and lots of novelty | Straightforward, intuitive interface with a reasonable amount of control of a good range of sound. Ability to perform live with a good degree of expression. Some simple assets created. | Basic interface with one screen. Some assets made and some acquired from online sources. Not too much variety in the expressiveness of the instrument | Simple or unintuitive user interface. User interface made from premade assets. Sound are premade or made using simple tools | Basic user interface that makes sound, without any expressiveness or novelty or much fun. | Project doesnt make any sound
| Documentation | 33% | Large number of commits. Good quality video demo and good documentation, with all sections completed. Commits evenly spaced throughout the project | Smaller number of commits over a shorter period of time, but a good bit of work evident in the latter weeks of the project. Video and documentation completed to high standard | All done in week or two before the delivery date. Lots of commits in last two weeks. Documentation incomplete or video incomplete. | All done in the final week. Incomplete documentation or video. Few commits | No use of git. project doesnt work |
