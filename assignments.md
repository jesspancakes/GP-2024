"A Musical Toy" 

![](images/cybertrad.png.jpg)

For this individual assignment you will be exploring musical play and experimentation, by creating a virtual musical instrument using Godot. 

This will be a screen where you press buttons, move sliders and it makes different sounds etc. It could be a toy that you give to baby brother or sister to entertain them on an ipad that makes animal sounds with pictures, or it could have more complexity and expressiveness. 

Your project should demonstrate:

- At least one scene with a nice looking user interface design
- Some interactivity with buttons connected up to some code that make sounds
- An array
- A loop
- An if statement
- Doing some basic stuff with Godot
- Making git commits

# Games Programming - Assignment 1

"Musical Play & Experimentation" 

![](images/cybertrad.png.jpg)

For this individual assignment, you will create an interactive musical experience using Godot. You can choose to make:

1. A Musical Instrument/Toy
   - A virtual instrument that makes sounds when you interact with it
   - A musical toy that creates fun sounds and visuals
   - An interactive soundboard with visual feedback

2. A Music Game
   - A simple rhythm game where you match beats
   - A musical memory game
   - You can start by [forking this example](https://github.com/skooter500/duckies2.0)
   - Watch [this video from GodotCon for inspiration](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEZvcG_TIHo)

3. A Music Visualizer
   - Create visual effects that react to music
   - Make patterns and shapes move to sound
   - Create an interactive light show

## Technical Requirements
Your project must include:
- At least one scene with a clear user interface
- Multiple interactive elements (sprites, animations, buttons, sliders, or clickable areas)
- Sound playback or generation
- Visual feedback when sounds play
- At least one loop (for example creating elements in a loop)
- At least one if statement (for example, checking if elements overlap)
- Regular commits to git showing your progress

## Learning Outcomes
- Understanding basic Godot concepts (nodes, scenes, signals)
- Writing simple GDScript code
- Creating user interfaces
- Working with audio in Godot
- Using version control (git)

## Project Ideas
Simple examples you could build on:
- A piano with colorful keys
- Animal sounds toybox for kids
- Simple beat maker with loops
- Shape-based music maker
- Musical memory game
- Audio-reactive particle system
- Drum kit with visual effects
- Sound effects board

2. Documentation including:
   - Project description
   - Instructions on how to use your project
   - List of features
   - Screenshots or video demonstration
3. In-class demonstration

Tips for Success:
- Start simple and add features gradually
- Commit your changes to git regularly
- Test your project frequently
- Ask for help if you get stuck
- Have fun experimenting!

Note: The rubric items are examples of what might be found at each grade level - you can demonstrate excellence in other ways not explicitly listed.
